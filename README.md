How It Works
API Endpoint: The application provides a single API endpoint /lifetime which returns the ID generated by the IdGenerator service.

Action Filter: The LifeTimeIndicatrorFilter logs the generated ID both when the action starts executing and after it has executed. This helps in observing how the ID changes (or remains the same) depending on the service's lifetime.

Setup and Running the Application
Prerequisites
.NET SDK 6.0 or later
Steps to Run

**Clone the repository:**



git clone https://github.com/your-username/LifeTimeCheck.git
cd LifeTimeCheck
Restore the dependencies and build the project:

dotnet restore
dotnet build
Run the application:

dotnet run
Test the API by navigating to http://localhost:5000/lifetime in your browser or using a tool like Postman or curl.



**Example Request**
curl http://localhost:5000/lifetime
Example Response
{
  "id": "some-generated-id"
}
Observing Lifetime Behavior
By changing the lifetime of the IdGenerator service in the Startup.cs or Program.cs file (depending on your .NET Core version), you can observe different behaviors:

Transient: A new ID is generated for every request.
Scoped: The same ID is generated for a single request, but different requests will have different IDs.
Singleton: The same ID is generated for all requests.
Logging
Logs are generated at two points:

Before the action method executes (OnActionExecuting).
After the action method executes (OnActionExecuted).
These logs will help you understand when the IdGenerator is instantiated based on its lifetime.
